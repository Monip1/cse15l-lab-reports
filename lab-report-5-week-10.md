Lab Report #5 Week 10

I used diff to differentiate the files.

When we look at the results file from class we find 
![results](Pictures/results.png)

List of differences in numbered .md files --

From file 494:
line 878 has `[\(foo\)]`

From file 495:
line 880 has `[foo(and(bar))]`

From file 496:
line 882 has `[]`

From file 497:
line 884 has `[]`

From file 498:
line 886 has `[]`


My results file showed

![myResults](Pictures/myresults.png)

From file 494:
line 878 has `[\(foo\]`

From file 495:
line 880 has `[foo(and(bar]`

From file 496:
line 882 has `[foo(and(bar]`

From file 497:
line 884 has `[foo\(and\(bar\]`

From file 498:
line 886 has `[<foo(and(bar]`

The actual outputs are
stacked 494 as the bottom error, 495 as middle, and the equal 497 amd 498 link on top.
496 has no link
