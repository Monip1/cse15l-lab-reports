Lab Report #5 Week 10

I used diff to differentiate the files. 

![difference](Pictures/diff.png)

When we look at the results file from class we find 
![results](Pictures/results.png)
From file 494
line 878 has `[\(foo\)]`

From file 495:
line 880 has `[foo(and(bar))]`

From file 496:
line 882 has `[]`

From file 497:
line 884 has `[]`

From file 498:
line 886 has `[]`


My results file showed

![myResults](Pictures/myresults.png)

From file 494:
line 878 has `[\(foo\]`

From file 495:
line 880 has `[foo(and(bar]`

From file 496:
